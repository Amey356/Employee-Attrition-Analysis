# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project analyzes employee attrition using Excel across three levels. Level 1 covers single-column analysis, Level 2 examines two-column relationships with attrition as the target, and Level 3 explores multi-column patterns. Each level includes interpretations and visualizations to identify key attrition drivers for better decision-making.
