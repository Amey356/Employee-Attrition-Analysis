# Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using Excel across three levels to uncover key insights. The goal is to identify factors influencing employee turnover and provide data-driven recommendations for decision-making.

## 📊 Analysis Levels
- **Level 1:** Single-column analysis to understand individual variable distributions.
- **Level 2:** Two-column relationships (Cat-Num, Cat-Cat) with attrition as the target variable.
- **Level 3:** Multi-column analysis to uncover deeper patterns and trends.

Each level includes detailed interpretations and visualizations to derive actionable insights.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified significant factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Discovered patterns and trends in attrition rates based on categorical and numerical variables.
- Provided data-backed insights to enhance employee retention strategies.
